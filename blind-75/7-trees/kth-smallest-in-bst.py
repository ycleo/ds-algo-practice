# Definition for a binary tree node.

# approach 1: Use recursive inorder traversal

            self.inOrder(root.left, stack)

        self.inOrder(root, stack)

# time: O(n)
# space: O(n)

# approach 2: Use iterative inorder traversal


class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        stack = []

        while True:
            while root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            curr = stack.pop()
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return curr.val
            root = curr.right

# T: O(H + k)
# H is a tree height. This complexity is defined by the stack, which contains at least H+k elements, since before starting to pop out one has to go down to a leaf. This results in O(log‚Å°N+k) for the balanced tree and O(N+k) for completely unbalanced tree with all the nodes in the left subtree.
